        "Description": "Microneedling, dry needling, and pinpoint needling can treat a number of issues, resulting in smoother, firmer skin. Microneedle clusters penetrate the dermis layer of the skin, causing the body to produce its own collagen. This results in improved appearance and texture, making your skin look younger.\n\nDuring healing, tissue adhesions under scars and wrinkles are released, allowing collagen and elastin to rise to the surface, which optimizes repair and rapid healing. After your needling session, nutrients and LED lights penetrate the open skin. This speeds healing time, induces more collagen growth and plumps the skin. Our sessions include highly-concentrated vitamins that are applied topically to the skin — designed to infuse your skin with nutrients vital to keeping it healthy.\n\nYou may find that many offices are now offering this service. However, microneedling has been around for a very long time (primarily in the permanent makeup industry), and Beaute Solutions technicians have extensive knowledge and experience with this procedure.\n\nRequires non refundable deposit\n\n***Affirm Payments accepts when you participate in our rewards program.",

(no down time and instant results)\n\nThis facial is for all skin types and delivers quick results without downtime. The procedure takes about one hour.\n\nTightens skin\nGently exfoliates\nSmooths wrinkles\nEvens skin tone\nReduces appearance of scars\nStimulates collagen production\nFAQ\nWhat is the Carbon Laser resurfacing facial?\nIt is a facial rejuvenation procedure which mimics the results of sex microderm sessions without the scratching or redness. It plumps the skin, deep-cleans and tightens pores, and lightens dark spots.\n\nWhat are the benefits of the laser facial?\nThe laser tightens skin, gently exfoliates, smooths wrinkles, evens skin tone, reduces appearance of scars and stimulates collagen production.\n\nHow is the procedure performed?\nThe technician applies a thin layer of carbon paste over the area to be treated (face, neck and décolletage). Once it dries, they then pass the hand-held wand or paddle that transmits the laser light beam over the skin to be treated. Once the procedure is over, the technician cleans your face and then applies our Restore Face moisturizer to deeply penetrate the skin.\n\nWhen will I be able to go in the sun?\nYou will need to protect the area with a sunscreen of 30SPF or higher or stay out of the sun to maintain your results. This treatment is safe enough to have weekly, but we recommend one monthly session with regular facials in between.\n\nCan you do this treatment on tan skin?\nIf you have been out of the sun for seven days, we can treat you with a carbon facial.\n\nWill there be down time?\nYou will be “flushed” for a few hours after the procedure, but you may return to normal activities immediately (excepting sun exposure, tanning beds or hot tubs).\n\nRequires non refundable deposit\n\n***Affirm Payments accepts when you participate in our rewards program.",

Thank you for your patience while we catch up from being closed due to the pandemic. \nNOTE:  Our appointment and communication system is now completely electronic and online.\n\nDO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTACT US THROUGH THE ADJOINING DOCTOR'S OFFICE - THEY DO NOT HANDLE OUR APPOINTMENTS, MESSAGES, TAKE PAYMENTS OR ANSWER QUESTIONS.  PLEASE DO CALL THERE OFFICE TO BOOK ANY OF THEIR SERVICES.\n\nOur phone line is an Announcement-only system for updates and appointments cannot be scheduled on it.  The pandemic has caused us to reduce our staffing and has created a backlog of appointments that need to be scheduled.  Our new completely automated system will make this task more efficient (so we can work on clients rather than be on the phone all day).  Please use the portal to book a date and time, check your appointment, change your appointment, fill out the required forms and to send us messages and pictures in a HIPPA compliant system. \n\nNOTE:  To become more efficient and to secure your privacy, we no longer are using any Social media, texting or other platforms to send messages.  All messages must be submitted through this platform located at:  beautesolutions.intakeq.com/booking\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  We are currently accepting services that are allowed by the state of New York.  Our availability is booking currently 4 weeks out.  As our system becomes more manageable, we will open up future time for booking.  Please check back daily for additional times to open. If you are a pre-paid or continuation service, there is a place for these appointments also.  Note they will go fast and you may need to check back daily.  We appreciate your patience as we adjust to this new system.  All appointments require a booking fee - this is due to demand and from no show appointments.\n\n1. We accept all major credit cards. Care Credit has to be processed manually at the time of your session.  We no longer accept wellness or care credit cards.\n2. Guests are not allowed in treatment rooms without prior permission.\n3.
